**Welcome!**  I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin, and a member of Professor Ufuk Topcu's [Autonomous Systems Group](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/facultysites/topcu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). Before my graduate studies in Austin, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering from [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/), France, in 2018. I also received a Master's degree in Computer Science from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), France, in 2017.

**Research Interests.**  My research lies broadly at the intersection of learning with prior knowledge, control theory, formal methods, and optimization. Specifically, I am interested
