**Welcome!**  I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin, and a member of Professor Ufuk Topcu's [Autonomous Systems Group](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/facultysites/topcu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). Before my graduate studies in Austin, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering from ISAE-SUPAERO, France, in 2018. I also received a Master's degree in Computer Science from École Polytechnique, France, in 2017.

**Research Interests.**  My research lies broadly at the intersection of learning with prior knowledge, control theory, formal methods, and optimization. Specifically, I investigate how prior knowledge (e.g., elementary laws of Physics) can be incorporated into learning agents to improve the data efficiency and generalization, and how such information may be used for the formal verification of such agents, particularly in the context of safety-critical engineering applications such as aircraft control and robotics systems.
